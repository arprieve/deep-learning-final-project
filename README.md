# CSE 490g Final Project
Aric Prieve

This is my final project for [CSE 490g Autumn 2022](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse490g1/22au/) at the University of Washington. The code for this project is [here](https://github.com/arprieve/deep-learning-final-project). 

### Abstract 

My goal for this project was to train a classifier to predict which national park an image was taken from. As data is at the core for successful deep learning I wanted to experiment both with training a convolutional network on new data and collecting that data to see the effects of a new type of dataset. I wanted to learn how difficult gather and assembling a dataset for computer vision was and if this type of data collection could yield something interesting/meaingful. In this project I did just that on the [national parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States) in the US. I learned a lot about data collection and thought I had some decent results in the end.

### Problem statement

I will create a datset of images of each of the National Parks in the US with about 400 samples each. These images will be scraped from the internet and will need to be standarized. This standardization includes normalization and sizing (256x256 images were used). I then will train a convolutional neural network of a few different types to compare performance both of the models on the dataset and whether this dataset needs improvement.
